## 🎶 Spectral Sound Processing Assignments

This repository contains the **9 assignments** for the course Digital Signal Processing for Sound and Music focused on **spectral processing techniques** of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds. The goal is to develop the basic theoretical and practical knowledge needed to **analyze, synthesize, transform, and describe audio signals** in the context of music applications.
